# Secret Santa

Simple project to create couples and send emails for a Secret Santa exchange.

It was created to organize 2017 Secret Santa with my friends, it is based on Laravel 5.5. Simply run `php artisan serve` and make a POST request to `localhost:8000/api` including, in the body of the request, a JSON body following the schema of `people.json` (you can have however many people you want!!).
